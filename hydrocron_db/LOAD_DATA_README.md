# How To: Load the Hydrocron Database with data from CMR

## Overview

The main data loading script is hydrocron_db/load_data.py.  This script queries CMR for the data granules from the collection to load into the database.

## Earthdata Login

The script uses the earthaccess python library to handle EDL and token generation. Configure the EDL credentials to use for the CMR query in environment variables called: $EARTHDATA_USERNAME and $EARTHDATA_PASSWORD, or in a .netrc file prior to running the script.

If you skip this configuration, you will be prompted interactively to enter the EDL username and password to use.

## Initial load of the database

Version 1 of Hydrocron uses two database tables, one for SWOT river reaches and one for SWOT river nodes.

To load river reaches into the database, run the load data script directly in a terminal with the following arguments, updating the date after --end_date to today's date.

    poetry run hydrocron_load --table_name hydrocron-swot-reach-table --start_date 2022-12-01T00:00:00 --end_date 2023-10-25T23:59:59 --obscure_data True

To load river nodes into the database, run the load data script directly in a terminal with the following arguments, updating the date after --end_date to today's date.

    poetry run hydrocron_load --table_name hydrocron-swot-node-table --start_date 2022-12-01T00:00:00 --end_date 2023-10-25T23:59:59 --obscure_data True

*Note: the --obscure_data parameter will multiply data values by a randomly generated integer during loading when True. This prevents real data from being made available publicly prior to the public release of the data, allowing for beta-testing. After the public release of the data, the obscured data will be wiped from the tables and --obscure_data will be set to False, allowing real data values to be available through Hydrocron.*

## Subsequent data loading

After the initial load, run the same commands as above to load new data, changing only the --start_date parameter to the date of the last load, and --end_date parameter to the present date. This will be done manually a limited number of times before integration with data ingest to the collection is ready.

If parameters are unchanged, previously loaded data will be replaced with the values from the granules in CMR.
## Reporting issues

If you encounter issues or error when loading data, please open an issue on the Hydrocron repository here: [https://github.com/podaac/hydrocron](https://github.com/podaac/hydrocron)
